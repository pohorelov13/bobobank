# BakingApp Demo

## About Me and This Project

Hello! I'm Bohdan, a Junior Java Developer passionate about building applications that solve real-world problems.

This project showcases my skills and expertise in Java development. It's a personal project that I've been working on to demonstrate various aspects of web application development. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple banking service, which allows users to perform actions such as user registration, login, updating user information, adding cards, and making transactions.
